# Repository of meta-models and meta-properties used for structural synthesis of optimal probabilistic models
This repository contains the meta-models (expressed in META-PRISM language) and the meta-properties used in the publication : 

> Toufik Benouhiba, *A Multi-level Refinement Approach for Structural Synthesis of Optimal Probabilistic Models*. Fundamenta Informaticae, to appear (2021).

It also contains some of the obtained models :
- The **meta-models** folder includes the source code for the problems being addressed in the paper: these meta-models are written in the META-PRISM language, which defines the structural constraints of the desired models at different abstraction levels. 

- The folder **meta-props** contains the the meta-properties of the meta-models : a meta-property is either a formal property or a restriction on it at any level of abstraction. 

- The folder **models** contains some of the synthesized models : the synthesized models are [PRISM] (http://www.prismmodelchecker.org) probabilistic models that comply with a set of formal properties and optimize another set of formal properties.
